# Hi 👋 #
<br />

I'm [Harvey Reynier](https://harveyreynier.com), a product-minded software engineer 🚀 currently based in London. I enjoy building consumer products that bring real value to end users. Right now, I'm helping to build [Snapchat on the Web](https://my.snapchat.com/)!
In my spare time, I try to build a few mini-projects a year, usually to learn new technologies or tools, please check them out below 🙋‍♂.
<br /> Besides programming, I love travelling 🗺️, coffee ☕, music 🎧, and Formula 1 🏎️!

My inbox is always open, so feel free to hmu 👍
